The aim of the project is to identify the applications that are used on the network and to identify whether there are variations in the   applications used by each user. This will look at day to day variations as well as differences after a longer time period, for example     after 2 months. In order to complete this, nslookup will be used to identify the domain names associated with some of the IP addresses     in the data set and will help to identify applications being used. These applications can then be classified and analysed.
